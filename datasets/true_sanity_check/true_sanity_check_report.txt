üéØ SANITY CHECK INTERPRETATION
----------------------------------------
Overall Average: 0.7273
‚úÖ GOOD: TRUE model shows reasonable consistency
   The model appears to be functioning properly

üí° RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------
‚úÖ Sanity check passed! You can proceed with confidence to evaluate your LLM responses

üìã NEXT STEPS
--------------------
1. If sanity check looks good, run TRUE evaluation on your LLM responses
2. Compare LLM scores to these baseline original scores
3. Look for significant drops in consistency scores
