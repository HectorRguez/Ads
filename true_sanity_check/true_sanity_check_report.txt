ðŸŽ¯ SANITY CHECK INTERPRETATION
----------------------------------------
Overall Average: 0.7335
âœ… GOOD: TRUE model shows reasonable consistency
   The model appears to be functioning properly

ðŸ’¡ RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------
âœ… Sanity check passed! You can proceed with confidence to evaluate your LLM responses

ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS
--------------------
1. If sanity check looks good, run TRUE evaluation on your LLM responses
2. Compare LLM scores to these baseline original scores
3. Look for significant drops in consistency scores
