# TODO
- DeepSeek API setup (Add the .env file with the DeepSeek API keys)
- Write the Hugging face dataset README.md files
- Finish downloading TRUE benchmark datasets.

# SOLVED
- Add links to Hugging Face datasets.
- Downloaded TRUE benchmark model `t5_xxl_true_nli`.
- The Mistral 7B version that I downloaded and added to the README.md is not good at following instructions.
- Experiment with a newer instruct version. It works way better!
