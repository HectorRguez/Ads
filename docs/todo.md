# TODO
- Write the Hugging face dataset README.md files
- Update the /insert_native_ads diagram. That process corresponds to `infer_remote_ads`.
- Add URL support
- Update README config.ini example
- Add _path to README
- Add sentence_transformers to environment.yml
- Avoid unexpected max_token limits throughout the codebase

# SOLVED
- Added links to Hugging Face datasets.
- Finished downloading TRUE benchmark datasets.
- Downloaded TRUE benchmark model `t5_xxl_true_nli`.
- The Mistral 7B version that I downloaded and added to the README.md is not good at following instructions.
- Experiment with a newer instruct version. It works way better!
