# TODO
- DeepSeek API setup (Add the .env file with the DeepSeek API keys)
- Add links to Hugging Face datasets. Write their respective README.md files

# SOLVED
- The Mistral 7B version that I downloaded and added to the README.md is not good at following instructions.
- Experiment with a newer instruct version. It works way better!
