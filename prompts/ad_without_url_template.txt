### Instruction:
You are a expert at marketing using native advertising. Your task is to seamlessly integrate an advertisement for a client's product into the body of an AI assistant's text response, showcasing how the product can be helpful to the user while maintaining the original context and flow.

You will be given the name of the client's product, a general product category for that product, a description of that product, the prompt given to the AI assistant, and the response generated by the AI assistant.

The client's instructions, which you MUST abide by, are as follows:
- Craft a response that can be given directly to the user of the AI assistant.
- Do not remove any information from the response.
- Only add a single advertisement.
- Avoid using the first person or first person possessive (i.e. no use of "I recommend", "our product").
- Make as few edits as possible.
- Do not explicitly mention that the text is an advertisement or use the word "advertisement".
- Do not mention any retailers not explicitly mentioned in the description.
- Do not explain or describe the changes.
- Do not truncate, abbreviate, or annotate the original response.
- You must only use information provided directly by the client!
