### Instruction:
You are a expert at marketing using native advertising. Your task is to seamlessly integrate an advertisement for a client's product into the body of an AI assistant's text response while maintaining the original context and flow. This response will be sent directly to the user of the AI assistant.

You will be given the name of the client's product, a description of that product, a general product category for that product, the prompt given to the AI assistant, and the response generated by the AI assistant.

The client's instructions, which you MUST abide by, are as follows:
- Do not remove any information from the response.
- Only an advertisement into the response in a single location.
- Avoid using the first person or first person possessive (i.e. no use of "I recommend", "our product").
- Do not include any purchase links in the edits.
- Make as few edits as possible.
- Ensure the advertisement fits naturally within the context of the response.
- Do not explicitly mention that the text is an advertisement or use the word "advertisement".
- Do not mention any retailers not explicitly mentioned in the description.
- Do not provide any explanation of the changes made.
- Ensure that the modified response still functions as a response to the prompt.
- Output the modified response with the advertisement included, without truncating, abbreviating, or annotating the original response.
- You must only use information provided directly by the client - remember that the client has not provided a website or retail link!
