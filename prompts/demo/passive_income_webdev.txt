As an AI language model, I do not have preferences, but here are some ways to earn passive income with your web development skills in 2023:

1. Building and selling web applications: You can develop a web application or a software tool that can automate a common problem or streamline a work process. You can sell these applications on platforms like AppSumo, Gumroad or SmartCents.

2. Create WordPress Themes and Plugins: WordPress powers a significant amount of the internet, which means businesses and website owners are always interested in ways to customize their website. You can create and sell WordPress Themes or Plugins on ThemeForest or CodeCanyon.

3. Affiliate marketing: If you have experience in web development, you can create web development tutorials on popular platforms like Udemy, Skillshare, and YouTube. You can share your affiliate links to useful tools like SiteGround Hosting, Elementor, GeneratePress, or ReactJS.

4. Create and sell stock photos and videos: As a web developer, you must have a keen eye for design. You can take advantage of this skill by creating stock photos and videos of web-related images like coding on a laptop or designing graphic elements for a website. You can sell these on platforms like DepositPhotos and iStock.

5. Buy and sell websites: You can also make a good profit by buying and reselling established websites that generate passive income. You can acquire websites on platforms like Flippa and FE International, and then optimizing them to increase their value before reselling them to a higher price.
